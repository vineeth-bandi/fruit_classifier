# fruit_classifier
A simple multi-class classifier for 15 types of fruit.
## Transfer Learning
Resnet18 and Resnet50 pretrained on Imagenet then finetuned using fruit images. In this project, I only replace the final linear layer of each network which might explain the slightly lower performance of Resnet50 compared to Resnet18.
## Results
### Resnet18
Accuracy of the network on the test images: 96 %  
Accuracy of Apple : 83 %  
Accuracy of Banana : 100 %  
Accuracy of Carambola : 97 %  
Accuracy of Guava : 97 %  
Accuracy of  Kiwi : 88 %  
Accuracy of Mango : 98 %  
Accuracy of Muskmelon : 99 %  
Accuracy of Orange : 100 %  
Accuracy of Peach : 100 %  
Accuracy of  Pear : 98 %  
Accuracy of Persimmon : 96 %  
Accuracy of Pitaya : 100 %  
Accuracy of  Plum : 100 %  
Accuracy of Pomegranate : 91 %  
Accuracy of Tomatoes : 99 %
